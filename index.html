            <h2>How we got started</h2>
            <p>While working as a Wildland Firefighter during college, I notices a lot of trees being cut down.
                Healthy trees would be cut down to promote healthy forest growth. I realized that nothing would
                be done with these trees once cut down. I started picking up small logs and brought them back
                home to craft something out of them. That's when I started gaining knowledge of woodworking.
                I started out with small projects such as clocks, stools, and drinking mugs. Soon after I gained
                more knowledge of crafting havested wood, I moved on to larger furniture projects, such as tables,
                chairs, and
                bookshelves.</p>
            <p>After about a year (2010) of working on my craft, I started going to trade shows to sell the pieces
                I had completed. These pieces gained in popularity because they were one of a kind items. Thats
                when it hit me, people dont want to have the same furniture pieces in their home as everyone else.
            </p>
            <p>In 2014 we started to grow as a company and opened up a workshop in McCall, Idaho.
                We started taking custom orders in 2015 with features: wood type, stain color, and many more options.
