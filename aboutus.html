            <h2>How we got started</h2>
            <p>While working as a Wildland Firefighter during college, I notices a lot of trees being cut down.
                Healthy trees would be cut down to promote healthy forest growth. I realized that nothing would
                be done with these trees once cut down. I started picking up small logs and brought them back
                home to craft something out of them. That's when I started gaining knowledge of woodworking.
                I started out with small projects such as clocks, stools, and drinking mugs. Soon after I gained
                more knowledge of crafting havested wood, I moved on to larger furniture projects, such as tables,
                chairs, and
                bookshelves.</p>
            <p>After about a year (2010) of working on my craft, I started going to trade shows to sell the pieces
                I had completed. These pieces gained in popularity because they were one of a kind items. Thats
                when it hit me, people dont want to have the same furniture pieces in their home as everyone else.
            </p>
            <p>In 2014 we started to grow as a company and opened up a workshop in McCall, Idaho.
                We started taking custom orders in 2015 with features: wood type, stain color, and many more options.

            <h2>Where we started out</h2>
            <p>Our shop started out in McCall, Idaho.  We got most of our material from harvesting local wood.  Harvested wood was gathered from the forest floor or salvage piles.  Something we still pride ourselves in.</p>
            <h2>What we are now</h2>
            <p>We have had steady growth every year and now have a workshop in Phoenix, Arizona.  We now have a team of Sawyers (chainsaw operators) that harvest wood from commercial forest plots.  For every tree taken, we plant one in return.  Soon we plan to purchase a plot of land and harvest trees responsible to promote healthy canopies.</p>
            <h2>What makes us different</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We take custom order that fits the furniture to your house.</li>
                <li>Customize template items to your needs</li>
                <li>Use locally harvested wood from Idaho, Oregon, and California</li>
            </ul>
